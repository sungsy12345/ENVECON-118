    "#### A recent paper investigates whether advertisement for Viagra causes increases in birth rates in the USA.  Apparently, advertising for products, including Viagra, happens on TV and reaches households that have a TV within a Marketing region and does not happen in areas outside a designated marketing region. What the authors do is look at hospital birth rates in regions inside and near the advertising region border  and collect data on dollars per 100 people (Ads) for a certain time, and compare those to the birth rates in hospitals located outside and near the advertising region designated border. They conduct a panel data analysis and estimate the following model:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ Births_{it} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 Ads + \\beta_2 Ads^2 + Z_i + M_t + u_{it}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Where $Z_i$ are zipcode fixed effects and $M_t$ monthly fixed effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### (a) Why do the authors include Zip Code Fixed Effects? In particular, what would be a variable that they are controlling for when adding Zip Code fixed effects that could cause a problem when interpreting the marginal effect of ad spending on birth rates? What would that (solved) problem be?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### (b) Why do they add month fixed effects? \n",
